    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Nutrino is a leading provider of nutrition related data services and analytics. As part of the data science team, we have been tasked to generate business insights curated from popular social media platforms. The company will be able to use that information to better understand customers & markets, enhance decision-making, and ultimately increase profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will first be scrapping data from reddit and using classification models such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to uncover patterns within 2 popular diets, Keto and Vegan. We will measure our success using several classificationmetrics inclusing accuracy and F1 score. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to reveal previously unrecognised sub-trends that pertains to attitudes, lifestyles and buying behavior, strong sub trends as opposed to passing sub trends. With a better understanding of the population and their eating patterns, our clients will be able to strengthen their targeted marketing campaigns and improve the success of their products and programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "As the data science team in Nutrino, we have been tasked to build a classifier to improve core product of the company, which is to provide nutrition related data services and analytics. We are also tasked to identify patterns on 2 currently trending diets, keto and vegan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our classifier was successful in predicting at an above 90% accuracy score. We also identified patterns in the motivations and preferences of the 2 groups of subredditors, which will help determine the kind of customer engagement with teach group. \n",
